## About Me

> After I was medically retired from the British Military due to a spinal injury, my Wife (who was born in Germany) and I decided to move to Germany with our son and dog in tow!  We found a beautiful house in NRW and have settled into village life. I have my work permit and residency in Germany and I am now looking for a job here, I would prefer WFH due to my injuries but I also enjoy traveling.

After a bumpy time (due to Brexit) I settled into life here and was looking at what my next career move would be and I saw an advert for the Digital Career Institute who taught (amongst others) Web Development so I applied.  I completed the 1 month assessment course and was then offered a full time place studying with them and began in July 2021. 

The course has been intense and interesting and i have learnt a "truck load" and I am under no illusion that I need to learn a lot more yet (whole life learning is something that i have always done!).  I am currently looking for a job in the IT industry and would love to chat if you feel that we would work well together.
